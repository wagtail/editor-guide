# Hosting environment

The Wagtail Guide is a Dockerized Django application running on Heroku:

-   Persistent data is stored in Heroku Postgres
-   Heroku Data for Redis is used as a cache
-   Logs are archived to Papertrail for historical analysis
-   User-uploaded files are stored in AWS S3
-   Email is handled by Mailgun
-   Sentry is used for error monitoring

The application itself runs in Heroku's Europe region (`eu-west-1` (Dublin, Ireland)).

## Deployment

Deployment is handled automatically by Heroku. When commits are pushed to `main`, Heroku automatically begins building and deploying the site. This deployment only occurs _after_ CI has run and passed.

Currently, only a staging environment exists, so `main` deploys to staging. Once a production environment exists, this will be updated.

## Access

The guide is hosted and managed by Torchbox's sysadmin team. Access is given only when needed following the [principle of least privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). If you need access to Heroku, a project maintainer can contact Torchbox's sysadmin team who can provide access.

## Support

Whilst Torchbox's sysadmin team maintain and monitor the application's infrastructure, this does not imply [support](https://torchbox.com/wagtail-cms/hosting-application-support/).
